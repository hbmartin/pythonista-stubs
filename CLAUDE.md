Here are the key best practices for writing Python type stub libraries:

## Structure and Organization

**Follow the source layout**: Mirror the structure of the runtime library you're stubbing. If the original package is `mylib/module.py`, your stub should be `mylib/module.pyi`.

**Use `.pyi` extension**: Type stubs should always use the `.pyi` extension, never `.py`.

**Include `py.typed` marker**: For stub packages, include an empty `py.typed` file in the package root to indicate it contains type information.

## Type Annotations

**Be precise but practical**: Use the most specific types that accurately represent the API without being overly complex. Prefer `list[str]` over `List[str]` (Python 3.9+).

**Use `typing_extensions` when needed**: Import from `typing_extensions` for newer typing features that need to work with older Python versions.

**Leverage generics appropriately**: Use `TypeVar` for generic functions and classes, but don't over-generify simple APIs.

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic
T = TypeVar('T')

class Container(Generic[T]):
    def get(self) -> T: ...
```

## Stub Content Guidelines

**Omit implementation details**: Stubs should only contain signatures, not implementations. Use `...` (Ellipsis) for function bodies.

**Include all public APIs**: Cover all publicly documented functions, classes, methods, and constants.

**Use `@overload` for complex signatures**: When functions accept different parameter combinations that return different types.

```python
from typing import overload

@overload
def process(data: str) -> str: ...
@overload
def process(data: int) -> int: ...
```

**Handle optional parameters correctly**: Use proper defaults and Optional types.

## Documentation and Metadata

**Include docstrings sparingly**: Only add docstrings if they provide type-relevant information not captured in the signature.

**Version compatibility**: Use `if TYPE_CHECKING:` blocks and version checks when APIs differ across Python versions.

**Mark incomplete stubs**: Use `# type: ignore` or add comments explaining limitations for partially-stubbed modules.

## Distribution and Packaging

**Follow naming conventions**: Stub-only packages should be named `types-{package}` (e.g., `types-requests`).

**Specify supported versions**: Clearly document which versions of the runtime library your stubs support.

**Keep stubs minimal**: Don't include runtime code in stub packages - they should be purely type information.

## Testing and Validation

**Test with mypy**: Run mypy against code that uses your stubs to ensure they work correctly.

**Validate completeness**: Use tools like `stubtest` (part of mypy) to verify stubs match the runtime API.

**Check multiple Python versions**: Ensure stubs work across the Python versions you claim to support.

The key is balancing precision with usability - your stubs should provide helpful type checking without being so complex that they're hard to maintain or understand.
